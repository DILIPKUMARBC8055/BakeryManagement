# Bakery Management System

This project is a **Bakery Management System** built with **C#** using **Clean Architecture** and the **CQRS Pattern**. The design focuses on creating a decoupled and maintainable system, leveraging modern software engineering principles and tools.

## Features

- **Clean Architecture**: Ensures a modular and maintainable codebase, separating core application logic from external concerns.
- **CQRS Pattern**: Implements the Command and Query Responsibility Segregation pattern for better scalability and separation of concerns.
- **MediatR**: Enables loose coupling between application layers, simplifying communication within the system.
- **AutoMapper**: Streamlines object-to-object mapping, improving code readability and reducing boilerplate code.
- **Comprehensive APIs**: Fully tested APIs for managing bakery operations, ensuring reliability and ease of integration.

## Advantages

- Decoupled architecture for easier testing and scalability.
- Improved code maintainability and clarity.
- Efficient handling of commands and queries using the CQRS pattern.
- Seamless object mapping with AutoMapper.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture
- **Patterns**: CQRS, MediatR
- **Utilities**: AutoMapper
